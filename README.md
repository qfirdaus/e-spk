# Student Management System (e-HEPA)

Student Management System (e-HEPA) is a web-based internal administration platform used to manage identity, access, configuration, documentation, auditability, and selected external-data workflows for institutional student operations. Although this repository originated from a broader reusable base platform, the runtime system currently operates with Student Management System (e-HEPA) branding, Student Management System (e-HEPA) settings, and Student Management System (e-HEPA)-specific operational behavior.

The current build functions as a production-oriented administrative system with working modules for user governance, group and menu access management, audit review, runtime system settings, documentation/manual management, email template administration, and controlled access to external staff and student data domains.

In its current functional role, Student Management System (e-HEPA) is used as the active project runtime identity for this repository. For future systems built from the same benchmark, the core platform features should remain consistent, while domain-specific workflows, entities, and reports can change according to the target system.

## Current Runtime Identity

The live runtime configuration currently identifies this system as follows:

- System name: `Student Management System (e-HEPA)`
- Browser/site title: `Student Management System (e-HEPA)`
- Organization short name: `e-HEPA`
- Organization name: `Student Management System (e-HEPA)`
- Support email: `support@upnm.edu.my`
- Default home: `pages/dashboard.php`
- Current version: `1.7.1`

These values are resolved through runtime configuration and application settings. The live runtime setting values are used as the source of truth for this documentation.

## System Overview

Student Management System (e-HEPA) is designed to support internal institutional workflows where:

- user access must be controlled centrally
- modules and menus are assigned by group
- administrative actions must be traceable
- runtime settings must be configurable without unsafe code edits
- the system must remain deployable across local, Docker, and server environments

At a high level, the platform combines:

- a MySQL application database for users, groups, settings, audit data, and application metadata
- Sybase domain connectivity for staff and student data integration
- a public web root structure suitable for safer deployment
- configurable branding, language, theme, and operational runtime settings

## Feature Benchmark Model

For cross-project reuse, the feature model for this repository should be understood in two layers:

- **Features Utama**  
  These are the core benchmark capabilities that should remain consistent across other systems built from this platform. They define the administrative, security, configuration, access-control, and operational baseline.

- **Features Tambahan**  
  These are system-specific capabilities that depend on the business domain of the project. In Student Management System (e-HEPA), the additional layer should follow the active project purpose and runtime identity. In other future systems, this layer can change according to the project purpose while keeping the benchmark core intact.

## Features Utama

### Authentication and Session Management

- **Login Portal**  
  Provides a branded login experience with multilingual support, system information, and secure session handling.

- **Unified Pre-Login Experience**  
  Uses a consistent institutional layout across the main login, forgot-password, reset-password, and forced password change flows so public-facing authentication screens feel aligned before the user enters the protected application area.

- **Theme-Aware Authentication Pages**  
  Applies the active global sidebar theme from runtime configuration to the pre-login experience, including the main header treatment, primary action buttons, focus states, and supporting visual accents.

- **Hybrid Authentication Flow**  
  Supports standard internal login using user credentials, while also keeping room for SSO-driven authentication flows where user identity may already be trusted upstream.

- **Policy-Driven SSO Auto Provisioning**  
  Supports first-time Staff and Student access through SSO without requiring every account to be pre-created manually in `tbl_m_user`. When enabled through Login Policy, the platform can prepare a full application user record automatically using the same identity mapping approach as synchronized source data together with configurable default group assignment.

- **Controlled Manual Login Readiness**  
  Keeps manual login stricter than SSO auto provisioning. Staff and Student identities that do not yet exist in `tbl_m_user` must complete first access through SSO when policy requires it, while Public users always require an existing administrator-managed application record.

- **Session Hardening and Idle Protection**  
  Uses secure session settings and inactivity timeout handling to reduce the risk of abandoned active sessions.

- **Logout and Session Cleanup**  
  Ensures user sessions are terminated cleanly and can coordinate with SSO-related cookies when applicable.

### Dashboard and User Experience

- **Dashboard**  
  Provides an overview page for the logged-in user, including profile context, quick access, health indicators, and operational visibility.

- **Theme and Interface Personalization**  
  Supports configurable layout and interface theme options so the platform can adapt to branding or user preferences.

- **Multilingual Interface**  
  Supports multiple interface languages and allows active/default language settings to be managed centrally.

- **Role Switching / Multi-Role Support**  
  Supports controlled switching of the active role context when a user has more than one permitted group assignment.

### User and Access Management

- **User Directory Management**  
  Supports searching, reviewing, adding, synchronizing, and organizing users in the internal system.

- **Auto-Provision Visibility**  
  Allows administrators to distinguish SSO-created Staff and Student records directly in the user directory through a dedicated visual indicator.

- **Group Management**  
  Allows administrators to manage user groups, define group identity, and structure access at scale.

- **Module and Menu Access Control**  
  Uses a modular access structure where features are organized by module and menu, and access is assigned by user group.

- **Access Matrix View**  
  Provides a read-only access matrix to help administrators review which roles can access which menus.

### Profile, Audit, and Accountability

- **User Profile Page**  
  Lets users review their profile, preferences, activity history, and account-related details from one place.

- **Login Activity Monitoring**  
  Displays recent login activity and session-related history for user awareness and administrative review.

- **Audit Trail**  
  Records important system actions and access-related events to support accountability, traceability, and troubleshooting.

- **Request Lifecycle Auditing**  
  Tracks request start and end metadata, including status code and latency, to improve operational traceability for administrative flows.

### System Configuration

- **General System Settings**  
  Allows administrators to manage runtime values such as system identity, branding-related text, support information, and selected operational settings from the UI.

- **Database Runtime Configuration**  
  Supports environment-based and operational-mode-based Sybase runtime selection for staff-only or staff-and-student access models.

- **Email Configuration**  
  Provides UI-based management for mail server settings, sender identity, and connection testing.

- **Theme and Language Settings**  
  Allows centralized control of default interface theme behavior and active/default application languages.

### Knowledge and Support Content

- **FAQ / Knowledge Page**  
  Provides general-purpose guidance for end users in a clean and readable format.

- **Manual Management**  
  Supports uploading and maintaining user manuals by group, helping each audience access the right supporting documentation.

- **Role-Aware Manual Shortcut**  
  Exposes a sidebar shortcut to the currently assigned group manual when a valid manual file exists for the active role.

### Operational Observability and Runtime Safety

- **Request-Scoped General Log Files**  
  Routes general application log output into request-specific files such as `page_index.log` or `ajax_user-delete.log` so operational debugging is easier than with a single shared log file.

- **Environment-Gated Debug Logs**  
  Supports explicit environment-flag control for targeted debug logs such as SSO handoff debugging and Tetapan Sistem AJAX diagnostics.

- **AJAX and Fetch Session Guard**  
  Intercepts terminated-session payloads for both `fetch` and jQuery AJAX flows so the UI can redirect users cleanly without ambiguous failure states.

- **Confirmation-First Logout Flow**  
  Uses a non-reloading logout confirmation flow in sidebar and topbar navigation so logout only proceeds after the user explicitly confirms the action.

## Features Tambahan (Khusus Student Management System (e-HEPA))

The following capabilities are the current Student Management System (e-HEPA)-specific layer. These reflect the present project identity and runtime naming used by this repository. They are important for Student Management System (e-HEPA), but they are not required to remain identical in other systems that reuse the same benchmark platform.

### Domain Purpose

- **Project-Specific Domain Layer**  
  Student Management System (e-HEPA) is currently positioned as the active project identity for this repository, with operational pages, role-based access, and administrative controls arranged according to the current system context.

### External Data Access and Domain Integration

- **Staff Data Integration**  
  Connects to a Sybase staff domain for staff lookup and related administrative workflows.

- **Student Data Lookup**  
  Provides controlled student search capability using a dedicated Sybase student domain without mixing student records into internal user management.

### Current Student Management System (e-HEPA) Application Surfaces

- **Dashboard (`pages/dashboard.php`)**  
  Used as the operational landing page for Student Management System (e-HEPA) users, including status visibility and role-aware context relevant to the project domain.

- **Student Lookup (`pages/carian-pelajar.php`)**  
  Exists as a supporting domain utility based on the current runtime model and may not be needed in every future system.

- **Reference/Test Pages**  
  Internal reference pages such as `data-staf-test.php`, `data-pelajar-tab-test.php`, and `tab-management-test.php` are project-side support surfaces rather than mandatory benchmark features.

## Current Application Modules

The current build already includes several working administrative and operational pages. The list below summarizes the feature surfaces that are actively present in Student Management System (e-HEPA) today. Items under the governance, configuration, profile, and audit model should be treated as benchmark-aligned core modules. Items tied to project-specific workflows or domain-specific data usage should be treated as additional project modules.

### Core User-Facing Pages

- **Dashboard (`pages/dashboard.php`)**  
  Provides the main landing page with user identity context, active role display, quick operational visibility, KPI-oriented dashboard data, health indicators, announcements, and optional system resource monitoring for privileged administrators.

- **Topbar Role Switcher (shared include surface)**  
  Provides role switching for users with extra permitted roles, allowing the active group context to be changed without changing the underlying default account identity.

- **Profile (`pages/profile.php`)**  
  Acts as the user self-service account page with profile details, login activity, audit trail visibility, active session awareness, preference-related context, and audit metadata inspection for Super Admin review.

- **FAQ (`pages/soalan-lazim.php`)**  
  Offers categorized internal guidance for system users, including help on login, navigation, profile usage, user management context, security awareness, and support flow references.

### Administrative Governance Modules

- **User List (`pages/senarai-pengguna.php`)**  
  Serves as the main user governance module for staff, student, and public accounts. It supports listing, searching, adding users, editing user records, assigning groups, updating access flags, managing extra roles, refreshing user data through modal- and AJAX-driven workflows, and identifying SSO auto-provisioned accounts directly from the listing UI.

- **Group Management (`pages/kumpulan-pengguna.php`)**  
  Centralizes management of user groups, module access, menu access, group identity styling, icon choices, ordering, and the structure used by the platform authorization model.

- **Access Matrix (`pages/access.php`)**  
  Provides a read-only matrix view that allows administrators to review which groups or roles have access to which modules and menu paths.

- **Audit Center (`pages/audit-center.php`)**  
  Functions as a Super Admin audit workspace with AJAX-based navigation across events, requests, sessions, changes, and security views, including filtering, paging, export operations, metadata inspection, and selected administrative actions.

### System Configuration and Content Modules

- **System Settings (`pages/tetapan-sistem.php`)**  
  Provides centralized runtime configuration for general settings, authentication policy, email settings and test delivery, database runtime selection, theme configuration, and language configuration. The authentication policy workspace now also includes dedicated SSO auto-provision controls for Staff and Student identities, together with configurable default group code assignment.

- **Email Template Management (`pages/template-emel.php`)**  
  Provides a structured workspace for maintaining system email templates, including template listing, filters, status management, placeholder usage, seed templates, subject/body content editing, and render-oriented template administration.

- **System Template Generator (`pages/template-generator.php`)**  
  Provides a scaffold generator for new system pages and related artifacts. It supports a tabbed creation modal for template form input, page icon selection, and access mode definition, together with compact preview output, collision detection, generated artifact tracking, and access policy selection such as `Super Admin Only` or `Group Menu Based`. The current icon picker offers 48 selectable icons for generated pages.

- **Manual Management (`pages/manage-manuals.php`)**  
  Supports upload, replacement, deletion, and group-based assignment of user manuals so that each audience can access role-appropriate documentation.

### External Domain Utility Modules

- **Student Lookup (`pages/carian-pelajar.php`)**  
  Provides controlled lookup of active student records through the Sybase student domain when student mode is enabled, including runtime-mode awareness and searchable results display.

### Prototype and Reference Pages

These pages appear to function as development references or internal UI prototypes rather than primary production-facing business modules:

- **Data Staff Test (`pages/data-staf-test.php`)**  
  Demonstrates an admin-style listing page with DataTables integration, sample add/view/edit/delete modal flows, and SweetAlert-driven feedback.

- **Data Pelajar Tab Test (`pages/data-pelajar-tab-test.php`)**  
  Demonstrates a tabbed workspace pattern with overview content, configuration form layout, history table rendering, and lightweight interaction examples.

- **Tab Management Test (`pages/tab-management-test.php`)**  
  Demonstrates a similar tabbed management layout pattern intended as a reusable interface reference for future modules.

## Key Improvements in Current Version

Compared with older and more tightly coupled approaches, the current version introduces several important improvements:

- **Safer deployment structure with `public/` web root**  
  The deployable web surface is separated from project-level configuration and tooling, which helps reduce accidental exposure of non-public files.

- **Environment-based secret handling with `.env`**  
  Database credentials and sensitive runtime values are no longer intended to live as hardcoded secrets in source files.

- **Docker-ready local deployment**  
  The system now includes Docker support for predictable local development and easier environment consistency.

- **Improved modular architecture**  
  Features are organized more clearly across classes, controllers, AJAX endpoints, pages, helpers, and configuration layers.

- **Runtime-configurable system settings**  
  Core business-facing settings can now be maintained through the system UI instead of relying only on static PHP configuration.

- **Multilingual platform behavior**  
  Language support is now more integrated into the user experience and administrative configuration.

- **Theme configuration and personalization**  
  Default theme behavior and user-facing presentation are managed more cleanly than in earlier static approaches.

- **Request-scoped operational logging**  
  General application logging can now be separated by request entrypoint, making troubleshooting easier for page and AJAX flows.

- **Stabilized confirmation and session UX**  
  Logout confirmation, idle-session prompting, and terminated-session handling are now more deliberate and less prone to accidental navigation behavior.

## Cross-Project Reuse Guidance

When this repository is used as a benchmark for other systems, the recommended rule is:

- keep all **Features Utama** intact as the mandatory baseline
- adapt **Features Tambahan** according to the business purpose of the target project
- allow branding, domain entities, external integrations, and operational workflows to change per system
- do not remove core governance, access-control, audit, configuration, session, and documentation capabilities from the benchmark baseline

In short, Student Management System (e-HEPA) defines the current project context, but the benchmark platform is the consistent administrative foundation behind it.

- **Sybase multi-domain runtime model**  
  The system now supports a clearer separation between staff and student external database domains instead of relying on a single active Sybase model.

- **Legacy configuration cleanup**  
  Older single-active Sybase patterns and legacy runtime assumptions have been reduced or retired in favor of more explicit environment and operational mode handling.

- **Improved deployment hardening**  
  Docker runtime, public-only serving, and environment-based secrets make the platform more suitable for controlled production deployment.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- PHP 8.2
- Apache HTTP Server
- PDO-based database access
- MySQL for core application data
- Sybase access through `pdo_dblib` and ODBC-based connection options

### Frontend

- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery
- DataTables
- SweetAlert2
- Alpine.js
- ApexCharts
- Tailwind CSS build support for selected surfaces

### Infrastructure and Tooling

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Apache virtual host configuration
- OpenSSL-based local SSL support
- `.env`-based runtime configuration

## High-Level Architecture

The system follows a practical layered PHP application structure.

### Request Flow

1. A request enters through the `public/` web root.
2. Core bootstrap logic in `includes/init.php` prepares the session, environment, configuration, translations, helpers, and security context.
3. Pages call controllers and service-style classes to load data and perform business logic.
4. Data is retrieved from MySQL and, where needed, from staff or student Sybase domains.
5. Views render the UI using shared includes such as head, topbar, sidebar, footer, and script assets.

### Main Application Layers

- **Configuration Layer**  
  Holds static defaults and environment-driven runtime configuration.

- **Bootstrap and Helper Layer**  
  Initializes sessions, language, theme, security behavior, helper functions, and request-level services.

- **Controller Layer**  
  Coordinates page behavior, validation, and data assembly for specific modules.

- **Class / Model Layer**  
  Provides reusable access to database connections, users, groups, configuration data, mail handling, and audit behavior.

- **Page Layer**  
  Renders the user-facing administrative interface.

- **AJAX Layer**  
  Handles asynchronous operations such as lookup, update, synchronization, and modal-driven actions.

## Authentication Overview

Authentication in Student Management System (e-HEPA) follows a hybrid approach.

### Internal Login Logic

- Users can authenticate using internal credentials stored in the application domain.
- Login validation checks account existence, password validity when required, and whether the account is active.
- Successful authentication initializes the user session, role context, language, and theme preferences.

### SSO Compatibility

- The system includes optional hooks for SSO-related behavior.
- The login flow is designed so that, when user identity is already trusted externally, the application can continue with internal user-session setup without relying exclusively on password verification.
- Logout logic also includes compatibility handling for SSO-related cookies or identity-provider coordination where configured.

### Authorization Model

- Authentication determines who the user is.
- Authorization is controlled separately using group assignment, module access, menu access, and active role context.

This makes the platform suitable for structured internal administration environments.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

For local non-Docker setup:

- PHP 8.2 or compatible
- Apache or another web server configured to serve the `public/` directory
- MySQL database
- Sybase connectivity support where staff or student external integration is needed

For Docker setup:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd e-hepa
```

### 2. Prepare Environment Variables

Copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your actual values, especially:

- `APP_ENV`
- MySQL connection details
- Sybase staff production/development connection details
- Sybase student production/development connection details
- DSN names where ODBC is used

### 3. Docker Setup

Build and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Notes:

- Docker is configured to serve the `public/` directory as the web root.
- The root `.env` file is provided to the container through Docker environment loading.
- Apache and SSL-related configuration are stored in the `docker/` folder.

### 4. Local Setup Without Docker

If running directly on a local web stack:

- point your web server document root to `public/`
- ensure `.env` is available at the project root
- create the MySQL database and required application tables
- ensure Sybase drivers, DSNs, and network access are available if those integrations are required
- verify write permissions for runtime directories such as cache, logs, and uploads

### 5. Verify Startup

After setup:

- open the login page
- confirm MySQL connectivity is working
- sign in with a valid account
- review dashboard access
- confirm role-based menus load correctly
- confirm logout opens a confirmation modal without immediate navigation
- if required, verify staff and student Sybase connectivity through the relevant administrative features

## Security Practices

The current implementation reflects several practical security improvements.

### Environment-Based Secrets

- Sensitive database credentials are read from `.env`
- Secrets are not intended to be stored directly in committed application source files
- `.env.example` is provided for collaborator onboarding without exposing real secrets

### Public Web Root

- The deployable web surface is served from `public/`
- This reduces the chance of exposing non-public project files directly through the web server

### Session Protection

- Session cookies are configured with secure defaults such as `HttpOnly`
- SameSite behavior is explicitly configured
- Invalid session identifiers are sanitized early during bootstrap

### CSRF Protection

- CSRF tokens are generated and used across form-based workflows and AJAX operations

### Authentication and Authorization Separation

- Login establishes identity
- Access rights are enforced separately through groups, modules, menus, and active role context

### Audit Logging

- Request-level and action-level audit logging helps track critical events such as login activity and administrative operations
- General runtime logging is now request-scoped under `public/log/` to make page and AJAX troubleshooting easier

### Safe Runtime Configuration

- Business-facing settings can be maintained through the system instead of editing source code directly
- Static defaults remain available as safe fallbacks

### Production-Safe Error Behavior

- Environment-aware bootstrap logic is used to reduce debug exposure outside development contexts

## Recommended Operational Notes

- Treat `.env` as sensitive and never commit it
- Serve only `public/` through the web server
- Keep role, module, and menu assignments tightly controlled
- Review audit logs regularly for administrative systems
- Review request-scoped application logs in `public/log/` when investigating page- or endpoint-specific issues
- Validate Sybase connectivity separately for staff and student domains after deployment
- Use Docker for consistent local setup when possible
